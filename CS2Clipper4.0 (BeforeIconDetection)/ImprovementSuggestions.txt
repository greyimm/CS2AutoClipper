HIGH SEVERITY:

QoL MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Make sure that all dependencies are automatically downloaded upon first install. 

Video Codec (Line 355) - Currently uses 'mp4v' which produces large, poorly compressed files. Should integrate FFmpeg for H.264 encoding 

MEDIUM SEVERITY:

Inconsistent Naming (Line 368) - Videos should all have naming conventions (add with icon detection)

Further Sorting Possibility: You could make it so that it detects if it is a deathmatch clip via the squares on the top, 
if there are more than 10 squares at the top at once, then the clip is definitely deathmatch. (Other tells could also help)

Another tell includes the timer being higher than 2 minutes

Another tell is that it detects more than 1 death in the clip. 
(Should only allow 1 death per 50 seconds to account for longer source videos.)

YOU COULD ALSO TELL IF IT IS COMPETITIVE BY SIMPLY CHECKING FOR ORANGLE, BLUE, PURPLE, GREEN, YELLOW squares at the top of the screen 
and if you can see 2 of any color then it is comp. 

LOW SEVERITY:

Flashbangs could potentially blind you for longer than the Disappear_Threshold. Test and fix this. 

Error Handling - One corrupted video could crash entire batch

ðŸ’¡ Top Enhancement Opportunities:

FFmpeg Integration - Better compression, smaller files, H.264 support
Batch Resume - Skip already-processed videos if script is re-run

ðŸ§ª Critical Tests You Should Run:

âœ… Edge cases - Kills in first/last second of video
âœ… Corrupted files - Make sure one bad file doesn't crash the batch

Would you like me to implement any of these fixes while you're testing? The top 3 I'd recommend tackling first are:

Consistent naming (easy fix)
Error handling wrapper (prevents crashes)

Change it so that pressing the run button for a second time will pause the trimmer. 
This will use a boolean that checks if it is true, run, if it is false, pause. 

COMPRESSION: 

Make sure to use FFmpeg and Handbrake (it is open source) so that you could compress your videos efficiently. 
Search up a Handbrake video compression tutorial to know exactly what values you need to conform the video to so that you could put it on Discord, for example.




NEW POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH DISCORD COMPRESSOR:

Discord compression happens AFTER all videos process.
If processing 100 videos, compression doesn't start until all 100 are done.
INSTEAD: It should compress immediately after each video


No validation that output folders exist before processing starts.

File naming race condition: Multiple processes might 
generate same output filename simultaneously.

Resource cleanup: If error occurs, CV2 windows might not close

Memory management: No limit on how many large videos can be processed in parallel

IMPORTANT: Discord compression deletion: Tries to delete original but doesn't handle permission errors well
The program should by no means ever delete the original source video. 

Video repeat detection is complex and should be extracted to function

Progress reporting only works in sequential mode

No progress indicator for Discord compression phase


PROBLEM WITH THE PAUSING SYSTEM: 

In Sequential Mode,

Checks for pause state before each video
Pauses immediately between videos

Instead, it should pause as soon as the button is pressed. (If feasible)

In Multiprocessing Mode,

Processes videos in batches (2Ã— worker count)
Checks for pause between batches
Allows pausing without interrupting current batch

Instead, it should pause as soon as the button is pressed. (If feasible)

ICON DETECTION : 

When making the icon detection code, the output folder should be selected and then the program 
should automatically make different folders based on the name of the clip.

ICON DETECTION PARAMETERS SHOULD SLIGHTLY SHIFT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOURCE VIDEO RESOLUTION. 
Base is 16:9, but 4:3 is also common, therefore the program should be able to account for this as well. 

MISSING ICONS : There are a few icons that are missing or that the CS2Icons Sheet has the incorrect version. 
All weapons are there but not all possible utility is there.
We are missing all the knife icons too.
