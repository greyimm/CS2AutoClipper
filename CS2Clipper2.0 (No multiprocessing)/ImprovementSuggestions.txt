HIGH SEVERITY:

Video Codec (Line 355) - Currently uses 'mp4v' which produces large, poorly compressed files. Should integrate FFmpeg for H.264 encoding

MEDIUM SEVERITY:

Resolution Scaling (Lines 107-109) - Killfeed detection uses hardcoded ratios assuming 1080p. May fail on 1440p/4K
Inconsistent Naming (Line 368) - Videos should all have naming conventions (add with icon detection)

Further Sorting Possibility: You could make it so that it detects if it is a deathmatch clip via the squares on the top, 
if there are more than 10 squares at the top at once, then the clip is definitely deathmatch. (Other tells could also help)

LOW SEVERITY:

Debug Output - Still prints in optimized mode
Pending Rectangle Spam - Prints too often
Error Handling - One corrupted video could crash entire batch

ðŸ’¡ Top Enhancement Opportunities:

Progress Indicator - Show real-time % progress during processing
FFmpeg Integration - Better compression, smaller files, H.264 support
Configurable Kill Threshold - Let users choose max kills (not hardcoded at 5)
Batch Resume - Skip already-processed videos if script is re-run
Multi-threading - Process multiple videos simultaneously

ðŸ§ª Critical Tests You Should Run:

âœ… Different resolutions - Test 1440p and 4K videos
âœ… ACE clips - Test videos with 5+ kills to see if they're valuable
âœ… Edge cases - Kills in first/last second of video
âœ… Corrupted files - Make sure one bad file doesn't crash the batch
âœ… Different CS2 themes - Some skins might use slightly different reds

Would you like me to implement any of these fixes while you're testing? The top 3 I'd recommend tackling first are:

Consistent naming (easy fix)
Error handling wrapper (prevents crashes)
Configurable kill threshold (adds flexibility)
