HIGH SEVERITY:

Video Codec (Line 355) - Currently uses 'mp4v' which produces large, poorly compressed files. Should integrate FFmpeg for H.264 encoding

Videos seem to be getting saved to other locations than the specified output folder. 

MEDIUM SEVERITY:

Resolution Scaling (Lines 107-109) - Killfeed detection uses hardcoded ratios assuming 1080p. May fail on 1440p/4K
Inconsistent Naming (Line 368) - Videos should all have naming conventions (add with icon detection)

Further Sorting Possibility: You could make it so that it detects if it is a deathmatch clip via the squares on the top, 
if there are more than 10 squares at the top at once, then the clip is definitely deathmatch. (Other tells could also help)

Another tell includes the timer being higher than 2 minutes

Another tell is that it detects more than 1 death in the clip. 
(Should only allow 1 death per 50 seconds to account for longer source videos.)



LOW SEVERITY:

Flashbangs could potentially blind you for longer than the Disappear_Threshold. Test and fix this. 

Error Handling - One corrupted video could crash entire batch

ðŸ’¡ Top Enhancement Opportunities:

Change the Resolution Settings to be the output and make the killfeed_region always be a proportion rather than a set value.
This way it will work with any source resolution. 

FFmpeg Integration - Better compression, smaller files, H.264 support
Batch Resume - Skip already-processed videos if script is re-run

ðŸ§ª Critical Tests You Should Run:

âœ… Different resolutions - Test 1440p and 4K videos
âœ… Edge cases - Kills in first/last second of video
âœ… Corrupted files - Make sure one bad file doesn't crash the batch

Would you like me to implement any of these fixes while you're testing? The top 3 I'd recommend tackling first are:

Consistent naming (easy fix)
Error handling wrapper (prevents crashes)


COMPRESSION: 

Make sure to use FFmpeg and Handbrake (it is open source) so that you could compress your videos efficiently. 
Search up a Handbrake video compression tutorial to know exactly what values you need to conform the video to so that you could put it on Discord, for example.
